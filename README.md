# Crop_Production_India
This dataset provides a huge amount of information on crop production in India ranging from several years. Based on the Information the ultimate goal would be to predict crop production using powerful machine learning techniques.
In this case after a indepth exploratory analysis I applied a random forest on the two most cultivated crops, being Rice and Wheat. On the test dataset I obtained a correlation of
around 98%
